# Water Quality Data Service

Water Quality Data Service (CSV â†’ Cleaning â†’ DB â†’ API â†’ Client)

The Water Quality Data Project is a full data pipeline that processes and visualizes water quality observations. It starts by loading raw CSV files, cleaning the data to eliminate outliers, and storing the cleaned dataset in a NoSQL database (MongoDB or mongomock). A Flask REST API is built to provide access to the data through endpoints that support filtering, statistics, and outlier detection. The project also includes a Streamlit client that communicates with the API to display tables, summary statistics, and interactive Plotly visualizations.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 0) (Optional) create & activate a virtualenv for Python 3.10+
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 1) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2) Put raw CSVs into data/raw/ 

# 3) Run cleaning + load into DB (Mongo if MONGO_URL is set, else in-memory mongomock)
python -m api.cleaning

# 4) Start the API
python -m api.app

# 5) In another terminal, start the Streamlit client
streamlit run client/app.py
```

## Switching between MongoDB and mongomock
- **MongoDB**: set `MONGO_URL` (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017`)
- **mongomock** (default): do nothing; the app will use an in-memory DB for quick dev.

## API (Flask)

- `GET /api/health` â†’ `{ "status": "ok" }`
